This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications involving asynchronous data access. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code where the application attempts to access data from a Firebase document snapshot before it's fully loaded, resulting in an error. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version using promise chaining or async/await to handle the asynchronous nature of data retrieval from Firebase.
